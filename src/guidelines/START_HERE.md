## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Where do I actually start?**
A: Open PRODUCTION_GUIDE_INDEX.md, it will guide you to the right place.

**Q: Is all this necessary?**
A: No - pick what you need, but security (SECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md) and testing (TESTING_STRATEGY.md) are highly recommended.

**Q: Can I skip to deployment?**
A: Not recommended - each phase builds on the previous. Follow the timeline.

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: 4 weeks if you dedicate 4-6 hours/day, or spread over longer timeline.

**Q: Can I do this alone?**
A: Yes! All guides are written for solo developers. Work can be parallelized with a team.
